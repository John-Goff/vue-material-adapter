# Material Components for Vue

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/pgbross/vue-material-adapter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/pgbross/vue-material-adapter)

Vue components (Vue 3.0) for [Material Web Components](https://material.io/components/web/) which uses the
[`Using Foundations and Adapters`](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/blob/master/docs/integrating-into-frameworks.md#the-advanced-approach-using-foundations-and-adapters) integration technique.

This project defines Vue components that use the `Material Components Web` library to implement Material Design.mization while sticking to the _Vue Spirit_ (approachable, versatile, and performant)

> _This is the Vue 3 version, for the Vue 2 version install `vue-material-adapter-legacy` see [Legacy Vue 2](https://pgbross.github.io/vue-material-adapter/tree/legacy) (semantic version references to the previous version eg. `vue-material-adapter@^0.17.3` will continue to work normally with Vue 2)._
