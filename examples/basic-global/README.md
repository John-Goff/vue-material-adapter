### Before You Start...

This example is targeted at beginners who want to start exploring Vue without the distraction of a complicated development environment.

For advanced features such as asset compilation, hot-reload, lint-on-save, unit testing, and CSS extraction, we recommend that more experienced developers use another example for inspiration such as the `basic-webpack`.

## Usage

This is an example project.

```bash
$ cd examples/basic-global
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
