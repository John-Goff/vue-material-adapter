[vue-material-adapter](https://github.com/pgbross/vue-material-adapter) is an integration of
[Material Web Components](https://material.io/components/web/)
and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) which uses the
[`Using Foundations and Adapters`](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/blob/master/docs/integrating-into-frameworks.md#the-advanced-approach-using-foundations-and-adapters) integration technique.

This project defines Vue components that use the `Material Components Web` library to implement Material Design.

## List is being updated

`vue material adapter` versions >= 4.0.0 use the the new list version from `material components web` in Menu, Select and Navigation Drawer. If you want to follow what is still recommended in `material components web` and use the deprecated list version for those components, then you will need to use `vue-material-adapter` version <=3.2.3.

> Please raise issues or pull-request suggestions on [GitHub](https://github.com/pgbross/vue-material-adapter/issues)

> NOTE: Material Components Web tends to release breaking changes on a monthly basis, but follows
> [semver](https://semver.org/) so you can control when you incorporate them.
> Similarly, `vue-material-adapter` will therefore often also have some breaking changes, but many changes to HTML layout
> or other API changes only affect the internal implementation so there will be less work in applications to adopt a new version.
